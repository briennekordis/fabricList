This project uses React components to fetch and display data from a JSON file about my personal fabric stash., such as material type and yardage available.  

## Languages & Technologies

## Suggestions for Improvements
- This project is still being developed so there is lots of room for improvement, including:

  - adding functionality for PUT requests to edit existing fabrics, such as to ammend the available yardage
  - adding functionality for DELETE requests to remove existing fabrics when they are completely used
